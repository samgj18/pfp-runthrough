  Here F[_] is a Higher-Kinded type which represents an abstract effect,
  most of the time this effect ends up being IO. But it could be any effect
  that fits the shape.

// The next step is to create an interpreter (usually this goes in another package
// and with create them with a make method. See https://github.com/samgj18/cards-game/blob/bcdd34792f1572aa63d66de47ad43aa3092d2735/src/main/scala/repositories/interpreters/InMemoryMessageRepository.scala#L13

// Is impossible to access the Ref outside the scope of the make function, in that way
// we ensure the "state shall not leak" principle. Remember, creation of Ref is effectful,
// thus, it allocates a mutable reference and the constructor returns F[Counter[F]].

  * Remember that a new Counter will be created on every flatMap call
  */

// The Type Class F[_]: Functor: Ref.Make could be subsumed by a single Sync however always
// apply the least power principle. We also avoid Foreign Function Interface FFIs.
